New Horizon Baptist Fellowship is a conservative southern baptist church. We maintain the London Baptist Confession of 1689, and enjoy a blended worship service enjoying both hymns and contemporary music for its content more than its style. The preaching at New Horizon is exegetical and book-by-book. Please come out and join us. All are welcome!
